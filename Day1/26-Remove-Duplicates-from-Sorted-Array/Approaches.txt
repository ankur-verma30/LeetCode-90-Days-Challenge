📝Approach 1:Using Two Pointer
👉 Take Two pointers j=0 and i=1.
👉 Take a counter=1 as we have already one unique element at index 0.
👉 Iterate from i=1 to n-1:
    ✅If current element is equal to the element at j, then continue.
    ✅Else, increment j, increment the counter and assign the value at i to j.
👉 Return counter, Gives total number of unique elements.
