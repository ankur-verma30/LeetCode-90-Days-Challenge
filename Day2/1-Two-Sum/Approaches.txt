❌ Brute Force:
Use two nested loops to check every pair of numbers in the array. If the sum of a pair equals the target, return their indices.

📝Approach 1: Using Single Pass Hash Table
👉 Create a hash table of integer, integer key value pair.
👉 It will store the number along with its index
👉 Iterate in the array and find if the target-nums[i] is present in the map or not.

✅ Intution: target-nums[i]=nums[index] => nums[index] + nums[i] = target.

👉 If it is present, return the current index and the index of the number in the map.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)

📝Approach 2: Two Pass Hash Table

👉 Create a hash table of integer, integer key value pair.
👉 It will store the number along with its index.
👉 Iterate in the hashmap and find the other value using the above formula 
👉 If it is present, return the current index and the index of the number in the map.

Time Complexity: O(2n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
