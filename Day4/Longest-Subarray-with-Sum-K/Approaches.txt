🔷 Similar Question : Extension of Longest Subarray with 0 sum

❌ Brute Force: Using two nested loops to check every pair of numbers in the array. find the maximum sum subarray and update the gloabl answer

Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(1)

📝Approach 1: Prefix Sum + Hash Table
👉 Create a hash table of integer, integer key value pair.
👉 It will store the current Sum along with its index. 
👉 Take global variable sum and maxlen assigned with 0;
👉 Iterate in the array:
    ✅If sum== target then update the maxlen=max(maxlen,i+1).
    ✅If sum-nums[i] is present in the map, then update the maxlen=max(maxlen,i-map[sum-nums[i]]).
    ✅Else map[sum]=i;
👉 Return maxlen

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n) // hash table to store the Sum
